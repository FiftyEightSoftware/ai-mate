- In-memory cache
- **Cost**: ~$50/month

### Stage 2: Growth (1K-10K users)

### Stage 3: Scale (10K-100K users)
- 5-10 instances

- Redis cluster
- Multi-region CDN
- **Cost**: ~$1,500/month

### Stage 4: Global (100K-1M users)
- 20-50 instances
- Multi-region database
- Redis geo-replication
- **Cost**: ~$9,000/month

### Stage 5: Enterprise (1M+ users)
- 100+ instances

## 🎓 Key Technical Decisions

### Why Redis?
- Reduces database load by 80-90%
- Improves response times by 60-70%
- Essential for scaling beyond 10K users
- Falls back to in-memory if unavailable

### Why Serilog?
- Structured logging for better debugging
- Automatic log rotation
- Easy integration with monitoring tools
- Production-grade error tracking

### Why Rate Limiting?
- Prevents abuse and DDoS
- Protects backend resources
- Fair usage for all users
- Cost control

### Why Multiple Deployment Options?
- **Railway**: Easiest for MVP
- **Fly.io**: Best global performance
- **Azure**: Enterprise features
- **Cloudflare**: Free CDN + DDoS protection

---

## 🚨 Known Limitations

1. **Azure Subscription Issue**
   - Current subscription has access problems
   - Workaround: Use Railway or Fly.io initially
   - Can migrate to Azure once resolved

2. **SQLite Concurrency**
   - Limited to ~100 concurrent writes
   - Solution: Migrate to PostgreSQL at 1K+ users

3. **In-Memory Cache**
   - Doesn't scale across multiple instances
   - Solution: Use Redis (already implemented)

---

## 🔄 Next Steps

## 💡 Tips for Success

### Development

- Enable Redis locally for realistic testing
- Check `/api/health` regularly
- Monitor logs in `logs/` directory

### Deployment
- Start with Railway (easiest)
- Add Redis immediately (huge performance boost)
- Set up monitoring from day 1
- Use Cloudflare for frontend (free + fast)

### Scaling
- Monitor `/api/metrics` endpoint
- Set alerts for slow requests (> 1s)
- Enable auto-scaling at 70% CPU
- Review costs monthly

### Cost Optimization
- Use reserved instances (save 30-70%)
- Enable aggressive caching
- Optimize database queries
- Use CDN for static assets

---

## 🆘 Support & Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Redis connection failed**
```
Solution: App falls back to in-memory cache
Check: REDIS_CONNECTION environment variable
```

**Slow response times**
```
Solution: Enable Redis caching
Check: /api/metrics endpoint
Verify: Cache hit rate > 80%
```

**Database locked errors**
```
Solution: Migrate to PostgreSQL
Cause: SQLite has write concurrency limits
```

**High costs**
```
Solution: Review /api/metrics
Action: Optimize slow endpoints
Action: Enable more aggressive caching
```
