What to test:
- Install and launch the app (label "AI Mate").
- Verify the app loads https://ai-mate.nickphinesme.com and shows a brief loading bar.
- Navigate core sections; try hardware back.
- Pull-to-refresh and confirm reload behavior.
- Rotate the device; confirm layout is stable.
- Offline/online transition behaves sensibly.

Report issues with:
- Repro steps
- Device model, Android version
- Screenshots/screen recording
- Logcat (if a crash occurs)

Thanks!
